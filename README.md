# WeatherPredictionAI
Advanced AI project predicting weather conditions using Bayesian Network and Naive Bayes

*DESCRIPTION:*

This project predicts whether people will play outdoor games based on weather conditions using a combination of probabilistic reasoning and machine learning. It generates a synthetic weather dataset with attributes like Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, and Wind, and uses a Bayesian Network to model dependencies and perform probabilistic inference, alongside a Naive Bayes classifier for comparison. The project includes visualizations of the Bayesian Network structure and Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs), evaluates model performance with accuracy and classification metrics, and exports the dataset for reproducibility, making it a comprehensive demonstration of predictive modeling and decision-making under uncertainty.
