Weather Prediction Using Naïve Bayes Classifier 

*DESCRIPTION:*

A Python-based Weather Prediction System using the Naïve Bayes Classifier and a user-friendly Tkinter GUI.
This project predicts whether the weather is suitable for outdoor activities based on inputs like Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, and Windy conditions.
It demonstrates probabilistic reasoning and machine learning classification using Scikit-learn, with an interactive graphical interface for real-time predictions.
